# getPokemonDataFromAPI
This project is used to grab data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and return the values that I want to use.

## Why did I build this project?
I am looking to create my own simple, but fully featured Pokemon Pokedex as a full-stack project. This was also a good opportunity to build tests using Jest.

### Disclaimer
I do not own the data used in this project. All Pokemon data was pulled from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
